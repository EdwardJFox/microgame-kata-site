Starting off with the basics, giving you a base for all the other katas. All you have to do is eat the banana!

## What

Mash the button to eat the whole banana before the time runs out.

### Criteria

- Draw a banana on the screen.
- On a players input, advance the bananas state one more step in being eaten. Start with taking off the peel, then eating the inside.
- On the banana being fully eaten, the game is won.
- Add a timer display. When the timer runs out the game is lost. In the original game, theres a bomb fuse sprite which moves along the bottom of the screen to display how long is left. In these Katas, its up to you how you want to display the timer, whether its text based, a graphic, or something else entirely! Mkaing re-usable timer now will come in handy for the rest of the microgames.

## Extra Credit

- Add some shake to the banana while it is being eaten. Once the banana is fully eaten, it stops shaking.
- Add some particles when the bananas insides get eaten. Wario is a messy eater!
- Add a background. The original game you're eating a banana in space, but you can choose whatever background you want. Extra extra credit for an animated background.
- Multiple difficulties; The original game required 5 presses for difficulty 1, 6 presses for difficulty 2, and 8 for difficulty 3. But do what you feel is best!
