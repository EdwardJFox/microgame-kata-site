One of the most iconic games in the Warioware series, perfectly nailing its childish tone and playful nature. Get the finger into the nose, easy.

## What

A finger is moving back and forth in front of a nose. The players goal is to get the finger into the nose, by stopping it at the right moment so its finger ends up in a nostril.

### Criteria

- Draw a player character which moves around the nose without the characters interaction.
- Draw a nose with two nostrils for the finger to go into.
- The player presses an input to halt the fingers movement around the nose, and the finger gets moves towards (and hopefully into) the nose from that position.
- After arriving at the nose, the player has either won if they made it into a nostril, or lost if they have missed.

## Extra Credit

- Multiple difficulties; The original game uses a pinky finger for difficulty 1, pointer finger for difficulty 2, and two fingers for difficulty 3.
- Unique interactions depending on where the finger hits on the nose. For instance hitting the middle turns up the nostrils, but go wild with it!
- A timer for the micro game, so the player has a limited amount of time to complete it. (Getting this done here will mean you can re-use it all future microgames!)
