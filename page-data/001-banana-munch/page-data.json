Mash the button to eat the whole banana before the time runs out!</p>\n<h2>Criteria</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Draw a banana on the screen.</li>\n<li>On a players input, advance the bananas state one more step in being eaten. Start with taking off the peel, then eating the inside.</li>\n<li>Add a timer with a basic countdown display to zero.</li>\n<li>\n<div class=\"loseState\">Lose State</div> The timer runs out.\n</li>\n<li>\n<div class=\"winState\">Win State</div> The player manages to eat the whole banana before the timer runs out.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Extra Credit</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Add some shake to the banana while it is being eaten. Once the banana is fully eaten, it stops shaking.</li>\n<li>Add some particles when the bananas insides get eaten. Wario is a messy eater!</li>\n<li>Add a background. The original game you’re eating a banana in space, but you can choose whatever background you want. Extra extra credit for an animated background.</li>\n<li>Multiple difficulties; The original game required 5 presses for difficulty 1, 6 presses for difficulty 2, and 8 for difficulty 3. But do what you feel is best!</li>\n<li>Make the timer re-usable in your chosen game engine. The timer concept is central to all the Microgames. To help with future katas, making a re-usable timer object now will make things a bit smoother.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Media</h2>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"/7b572bb4ebe4487b35bc6c4ae8285b5b/banana_munch_diff_1_success.gif\" alt=\"example of banana munch where the player wins\">\n  <figcaption>Winning a round by finishing off the banana.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"/4daadf269b2b271c4fc13802f5491bc0/banana_munch_diff_1_failure.gif\" alt=\"example of banana munch where the player loses\">\n  <figcaption>Losing a round by not finishing the banana off in time!</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2>Submissions</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Made By</th>\n<th>Engine</th>\n<th>Link</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>EdwardJFox</td>\n<td>Godot 3.4</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://github.com/EdwardJFox/microgame-kata-godot/tree/main/minigames/banana_munch\">GitHub</a></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><a href=\"/submit\">Submit your kata here</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Banana Munch","number":1,"published_at":"June 16, 2022","last_updated_at":"June 16, 2022","description":null,"thumbnail":{"publicURL":"/static/72fef14b22c73d7a57196fc4ec1618a3/thumb.png"}}},"previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/002-gold-digger/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Gold Digger"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"7a5e27c2-3284-5877-be4d-0181ab12b9a9","previousPostId":null,"nextPostId":"556755c6-51e4-54e3-865d-df222badcda4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","3257411868"]}
