A finger is moving back and forth in front of a nose. The players goal is to get the finger into the nose, by stopping it at the right moment so its finger can be thrust up directly into a nostril.</p>\n<h2>Criteria</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Draw a player character which moves around the nose without the characters interaction.</li>\n<li>Draw a nose with two nostrils for the finger to go into.</li>\n<li>The player presses an input to halt the fingers movement around the nose, and the finger gets moves towards (and hopefully into) the nose from that position.</li>\n<li>\n<div class=\"loseState\">Lose State</div> The finger does not go into one of the nostrils, whether missing the nose completely or hitting the outside/middle of the nose.\n</li>\n<li>\n<div class=\"winState\">Win State</div> The finger makes it into one of the nostrils.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Extra Credit</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Multiple difficulties; The original game uses a pinky finger for difficulty 1, pointer finger for difficulty 2, and two fingers (one for each nostril) for difficulty 3.</li>\n<li>Unique interactions depending on where the finger hits on the nose. E.g. instance hitting the middle turns up the nostrils, but go wild with it!</li>\n<li>\n<div class=\"loseState\">Lose State</div> The timer runs out.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Media</h2>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"/83e1f860aa68f5c5c8745b385227ec16/gold_digger_diff_1_success.gif\" alt=\"example of a warioware round where the player wins\">\n  <figcaption>The player winning a round by getting the finger in the nose successfully.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"/639377b5fe4c5a0588f8791443e4cb54/gold_digger_diff_1_failure.gif\" alt=\"example of a warioware round where the player loses\">\n  <figcaption>The player loses a round by hitting the right side of the nose with the finger.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2>Submissions</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Made By</th>\n<th>Engine</th>\n<th>Link</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>EdwardJFox</td>\n<td>Godot 3.4</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://github.com/EdwardJFox/microgame-kata-godot/tree/main/minigames/gold_digger\">GitHub</a></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><a href=\"/submit\">Submit your kata here</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Gold Digger","number":2,"published_at":"June 16, 2022","last_updated_at":"June 16, 2022","description":null,"thumbnail":{"publicURL":"/static/641e629dc03cf1961b3d58c2cdaae345/thumb.png"}}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/001-banana-munch/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Banana Munch"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/003-body-block/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Body Block"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"556755c6-51e4-54e3-865d-df222badcda4","previousPostId":"7a5e27c2-3284-5877-be4d-0181ab12b9a9","nextPostId":"67e42c85-ff16-5b0c-9c10-4fc290424fc1"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","3257411868"]}
